# Dee Cross
## This is a site dedicated to the memory of my mom, Denise Crosthwait.
The intention of this site is to provide friends, family, & fans a central source for information about Dee, as well 
as to create an easy to share resource for the celebration of her life in July 2024. Also, after the inventory 
process is complete, this site will also serve as a showcase of her work.

### Resources
Site was developed by her daughter, @jmzager0110
Deployment administration per legacy account

### Technical Details
Constructed via Bootstrap Temple
Deployment via GitHub Pages on legacy account

### General Notes
Y'all, losing a parent is hard enough. In the process, I lost a best friend, a real deal ride or die, a
daily virtual companion, a constant source of support, accolades & enthusiasm. That was my mom, my whole
life, and she was only just 69. Every single thing went too fast, & this is harder than comprehensible. 

I tasked myself with making a live site in two days, so I used a Bootstrap template, & hey! This one wasn't bloated 
& has very few typos! 

This was a good distraction, & will continue to be as I begin adding images of her work over time.
